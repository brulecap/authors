/***************************** MUST READ *****************************/
When creating a new author, books is ignored if provided.
When updating an author, updating a book, or deleting a book, the author object is considered to be
complete including the book array. Example: If an author had 7 books and you updated the author with
an empty books array. All those books would be deleted as well.

TODO: An author should be able to be updated without including books. A book should be able to be deleted
with just the author id and book id and a book should be able to be updated with just a author id, book id
and book object.
